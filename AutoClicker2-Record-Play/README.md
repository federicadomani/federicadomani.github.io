### {{page.app_name_ex}} - How to edit a mouse clicking sequence.

We assume AutoClicker2Ex.exe is running and few clicking events have been added to the sequence. Look at the list resides in a top right part of the main window.
Now you can edit each column of the list. First column contains X-coordinate of the clicking event.
Second column contains Y-coordinate of the clicking event. Third column contains a mouse button to click (L-Left, M-Middle, R-Right).
Fourth column contains a time interval to the next click in milliseconds.

You can edit the list by double-clicking on the column and row you wish to modify, then type a new parameter value. This is a standard Windows list widget.
To modify mouse button, after double click to the corresponding column/row, you can type L/l (for left mouse button), M/m (for middle mouse button), R/r (for right mouse button),
regardless a letter case.

for each clicking event in the sequence.

Ok, then in the main window click on the "Load Sequence" button.
Standard Windows dialog appears to choose a text file with mouse clicking sequence to load.
Select a text file with previously recorded sequence and click on the "Open" button.
If a file contains no error, new clicking sequence will be loaded from a file to the working list.
You can then playback or edit the sequence as usual.
