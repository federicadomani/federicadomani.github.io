{{page.app_name}} is the world's top 2 mouse auto clicker application in 2022.

{{page.app_name}} is a mature mouse clicker framework for Windows that can record, save, play and randomize the whole groups/sequences/lists of mouse clicks/actions/events as well as operate with fine structures of clicking sequences to vary mouse button, time interval between clicks and much more.
As its predecessors, AutoClicker2 is a full-fledged autoclicker with two modes of autoclicking, at your dynamic cursor location or at a prespecified location. The maximum amounts of clicked can also be set (or left as infinite).

{{page.app_name}} can click: 1) at current mouse position on your PC desktop 2) via a sequence of user-defined mouse coordinates that can be recorded and stored into a text file 3) at random points in a bounding rectangle determined automatically on arbitrary clicking sequence recorded previously and saved to a file.

{{page.app_name}} Extended can operate with fine structures of clicking groups/sequences/lists. It allows to record the mouse actions with different clicking buttons, time intervals, etc.

No more performing mouse clicks manually!
With AutoClicker2 Record Play The Lists Of Mouse Clicks, you can automate the task of clicking repeatedly on a particular point on the PC screen.
Depending on the target point and clicking speed, number of clicks, mouse button, and other parameters, an action will be performed
on your PC display on a fixed location, or through a sequence of mouse clicks you previously recorded, edited, and debugged.

You can use this software to continuously automate mouse clicks on any part of PC display and can easily keep the automated tasks running over night or few days.
